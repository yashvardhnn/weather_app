Weather App
Here's a summary of the key components and functionality:

1. HTML Structure:
The app's structure is built using basic HTML, with a meta tag to ensure responsiveness on various devices.
The main content is wrapped inside a div with a class of card, which contains:
A search bar where users can input the city name.
An error message section that displays if the city name is invalid.
A weather display section showing the weather icon, temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed.

2. CSS Styling:
The app references a style.css file to handle the styling, though the specific styles are not provided here.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
API Integration: The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the city entered by the user.
The API key is stored in a variable apiKey, and the API URL is constructed with the city name and API key.
Search Functionality:
The app listens for a click event on the search button. When triggered, it calls the checkWeather function, which fetches data from the API.
Error Handling:
If the API returns a 404 status (meaning the city was not found), an error message is displayed, and the weather information is hidden.
Weather Display:
If the city is found, the app updates the display with the city's name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a corresponding weather icon based on the weather conditions (e.g., clouds, rain, clear skies).
Dynamic Icon Display:
The weather icon changes dynamically based on the weather condition (e.g., clouds, clear, rain).

4. User Interaction:
Users can type a city name in the search box and click the search button to get the current weather for that city.
The app handles invalid city names gracefully by showing an error message without crashing or displaying incorrect data.

5. Responsive Design:
The inclusion of the meta viewport tag indicates that the app is designed to be responsive, making it accessible on various devices.

6. Visual Elements:
The app uses images to represent weather conditions (e.g., clouds, clear skies, rain) and displays icons for humidity and wind speed.
The provided CSS styling for your weather app enhances the appearance and user experience by applying various design principles. Here's a summary of how the CSS complements the HTML:

7. Global Styles:
Reset and Box-Sizing:
All elements have their margin and padding set to 0, ensuring consistent spacing throughout.
box-sizing: border-box; ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.
Font and Background:
The font family is set to 'Poppins', a clean and modern sans-serif font.
The body background is a solid dark color (#222), creating a strong contrast with the content.

8. Card Styling:
The .card class styles the container for the weather app:
It uses a gradient background (linear-gradient(135deg,#00feba,#5b548a)) that shifts from a bright teal to a deep purple.
The text color is set to white (#fff), ensuring readability.
The card is centered on the page with a maximum width of 470px and a responsive width of 90%.
It has rounded corners (border-radius: 20px) and padding to ensure content is not cramped.

9. Search Bar:
Flexbox Layout:
The search bar (.search) uses Flexbox to align its items, with the input and button spaced evenly.
Input Field:
The input field has a light background (#ebfffc) with a subtle gray text color, making it easy to read user input.
It has a large height and rounded corners for a friendly, modern look.
Search Button:
The button has a circular design with the same background as the input field, and it uses a small search icon.

10. Weather Display:
Weather Icon:
The weather icon is large (170px), ensuring it’s easily visible.
Temperature and City Name:
The temperature is displayed with a large font size (80px), making it the focal point.
The city name is slightly smaller (45px) and positioned close to the temperature for clarity.
Details Section:
The humidity and wind speed are presented side by side, each with its icon, using Flexbox for alignment.
The text is large and clear, ensuring it’s easily readable.

11. Error Handling:
The error message is styled with smaller text (14px) and left-aligned, ensuring it doesn’t dominate the screen but is still noticeable when displayed.

12. Responsiveness and Visibility:
The .weather and .error elements are initially hidden (display: none;) and only shown when appropriate, based on the user’s input and the data fetched.

Summary:
Your weather app is a user-friendly, responsive tool that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It handles errors gracefully and dynamically updates the weather display with relevant icons and information based on the user's input.
